# Amazon Product Review Analysis using Excel

## Overview  
This project was based on a dataset containing Amazon product reviews. My goal was to clean the data, explore it using Excel, and answer key business questions through analysis and visual insights. I used Excel features like pivot tables, formulas, and charts to summarize the data and build a simple dashboard.

## Tools Used  
- Microsoft Excel  
- Pivot Tables  
- Formulas (`IF`, `COUNTIF`, `AVERAGEIF`)  
- Basic Charts (Bar, Column, Pie)

## Objective  
The task was to understand product performance based on reviews and pricing. I analyzed things like average discounts, most reviewed products, product rating patterns, and how prices were distributed across categories.

## Key Steps

### 1. Data Cleaning  
I started by removing duplicate entries and rows with missing data. Some product categories were shown as long paths, so I focused on the main category to simplify the analysis.  
*You can add screenshots of the raw and cleaned data here if needed.*

### 2. Pivot Table Analysis  
I created several pivot tables to answer specific questions:
- Average discount by product category  
- Most reviewed products  
- Highest-rated products  
- Review counts by price range

### 3. Dashboard Creation  
I combined the most useful charts and KPIs into one dashboard sheet. This included bar and pie charts showing category performance, top-rated products, and review count comparisons.

**Q4. How are the products priced?**  
Answer: Most products fell into mid-to-high price ranges. I grouped them into:
- Under 1000 **464**
- 1000 to 10000  **185**
- Over 10000  **702**

**Q5. Do ratings change by price range?**  
Answer: **Yes, ratings appear to improve as the product price increases.**

- Lower-priced products (under 1000) had an average rating of about 3.9

- Mid-range products (1000â€“10000) were rated slightly better, around 4.3

- High-end products (over 10000) had the highest ratings, averaging around 4.6

## What I Learnt  
This was a great exercise in using Excel to work with raw data and extract useful insights. I got better at using pivot tables for summaries and formulas for deeper analysis. I also practiced organizing results into a simple dashboard for easy interpretation and reporting.
